The Problem Statement is as follows: -
Our NGO, HELP INTERNATIONAL, strengthens poor countries by fighting poverty and providing the citizens of these countries with basic amenities.
In a recent funding, our organization has accumulated around 10 million US Dollars, our well-intentioned CEO now has a task upon himself to best use these fundsâ€¦
So, we as his data analyst team are supposed to categorize the countries using some socio-economic and health factors and provide him with a list of at least 5 countries, which are in dire need of these funds and can make the most out of this.
